# What went wrong? Troubleshooting Javascript

## Q: Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A:Syntax Error: Occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language, resulting in the code not being able to run or compile. Examples include misspelling a keyword, leaving out a semicolon or parentheses, or using an incorrect operator.
Logic Error: Occurs when the code runs without error, but produces unexpected or incorrect results due to a flaw in the program's logic. Examples include using the wrong formula or algorithm, incorrectly nested loops, or faulty conditional statements.

## Q: List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

A:Syntax Errors: These are usually the easiest to spot and correct. In past lab assignments, I have encountered syntax errors such as missing semicolons, misspelled keywords, or incorrect use of quotation marks. I was able to correct these errors by carefully reviewing my code and making the necessary corrections.

Logic Errors: These errors are more difficult to identify and correct. In one past lab assignment, I encountered a logic error in a program that was supposed to calculate the average of a set of numbers. The program ran without errors, but the output was not correct. I was able to correct the error by carefully reviewing the program's logic and identifying a flaw in the formula used to calculate the average.

## Q: How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

A: Understanding the difference between syntax errors and logic errors is essential for writing efficient and effective code. As a programmer, I will continue to encounter both types of errors in my future work, and being able to quickly identify and correct them will be crucial to my success. Additionally, knowing how to avoid these errors altogether by writing well-structured and well-documented code will help me to become a more skilled and efficient programmer.

# The Javascript Debugger.

## Q: How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

A: The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that allows software developers to pause the execution of their code at any point and step through it line by line to identify and fix errors. It's an essential tool for debugging complex code and can save developers a lot of time and effort by helping them quickly identify and correct errors. The debugger works by allowing the developer to set breakpoints in their code, which are points where the execution of the code will pause, and the developer can inspect the current state of the program and make changes or corrections as needed.

## Q: Define what a breakpoint is.

A: A breakpoint is a specific point in a program's code where the execution of the program will pause, allowing the developer to inspect the program's state at that point. By setting a breakpoint, the developer can step through the code line by line, examining variables, and identifying errors or unexpected behavior.

## Q: What is the call stack?

A: The call stack is a data structure used by programming languages to keep track of the functions that are currently being executed. Whenever a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack, and when the function returns, it is removed from the stack. The call stack is used to manage the flow of execution in a program and is an essential concept for understanding how function calls and recursion work in programming. When a function is called, any variables or parameters passed to the function are added to a new frame on the call stack, which is removed when the function returns.
