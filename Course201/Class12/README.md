# Javascript Canvas
## Q: What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to achieve?

A: The `<canvas>` element in HTML allows a developer to create dynamic, interactive graphics and animations on a web page. It provides a 2D drawing context where developers can use JavaScript to draw shapes, text, and images, as well as create animations and visual effects. The canvas can be styled with CSS and supports event handling, so developers can create interactive experiences that respond to user input.

## Q: What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

A: The closing `</canvas>` tag is important because it marks the end of the canvas element and ensures that the browser can properly parse the HTML code. Without the closing tag, the browser may not recognize the canvas element or may not render it correctly. It's always important to make sure that HTML elements are properly opened and closed to ensure that the browser can interpret the code correctly.

## Q: Explain what the getContext() method does.

A: The getContext() method is used to obtain a drawing context for a canvas element. This method takes one argument, which specifies the type of context to create (e.g. "2d" for a 2D drawing context or "webgl" for a WebGL context). Once a context has been obtained, the developer can use various drawing methods to create shapes, text, and images on the canvas. The getContext() method is a crucial part of working with the canvas element, as it provides access to the drawing tools that developers need to create dynamic and interactive graphics on a web page.

A: There are several advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table:

Visualization - Charts allow data to be visualized in a way that is easy to understand and interpret, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.

Simplification - Charts can simplify complex data sets, making it easier for viewers to grasp key insights without having to sift through large amounts of information.

Comparison - Charts allow for easy comparison of data between different categories or time periods, which can be more difficult to achieve with a table.

Engagement - Charts can be more engaging and visually appealing than tables, which can help to capture and maintain viewers' attention.
