# Javascript object basics

To describe an object to a non-technical friend, I would say that an object is like a container that can hold different pieces of information about something. It's like a digital filing cabinet that keeps track of all the important details related to a specific thing, such as a person, a car, or a book.

There are several advantages to creating object literals in programming. Object literals are a way to create objects in JavaScript by defining their properties and values using curly braces. Some advantages of using object literals include:

They allow for easy creation of complex data structures with nested properties.
They make code more readable by grouping related properties together.
They can be used to create reusable code by defining objects once and then referencing them multiple times.
Objects differ from arrays in several ways. While arrays are a way to store ordered collections of data in JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs. Arrays use numeric indices to access elements, while objects use keys to access values. Additionally, arrays are used when the order of the data is important, while objects are used when the data is more structured and has meaningful keys.

An example of when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property instead of dot notation is when the property name contains special characters or spaces. For example, if an object had a property called "favorite color," you would need to use bracket notation to access it

The 'this' term in this code refers to dog.
The advantage of using this in this context is that it allows the method to access the properties of the dog object without needing to explicitly refer to the object name. This makes the code more flexible and reusable, as the same method could be used for different objects with different properties, as long as those properties are named the same way.

The DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the web page as a tree-like structure of objects, where each object represents a part of the document, such as an element or a text node.

In other words, the DOM is a way for web browsers to interpret and manipulate web pages using code. It allows developers to access and modify the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically, without needing to reload the entire page.

JavaScript and the DOM have a close relationship because JavaScript can interact with the DOM in many ways. JavaScript can access and modify the elements and properties of the DOM, such as changing the content of an HTML element, adding or removing elements from the page, or changing the style of an element. JavaScript can also respond to events triggered by user actions, such as clicking a button or submitting a form.

By using JavaScript and the DOM together, developers can create dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user actions and update in real-time.
