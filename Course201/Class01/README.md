## Http Poem
 HTTP, oh how you glide
Data streaming side to side
Requests sent without delay
Responses swift, without dismay

Packet by packet, you do send
From server to client without end
Through cables and routers, you flow
Data transfer, smooth as a bow

A protocol, so well-defined
Your power, truly unconfined
Sending data, far and wide
HTTP, how you gracefully glide.

## What is an HTML attribute
An HTML attribute is a characteristic or property that provides additional information about an HTML element, beyond its tag name and content. Attributes are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element and can be added to the opening tag of the element.


## HTML element Anatomy
An HTML element consists of several parts, which are:

Opening tag: The opening tag is the first part of an HTML element, which consists of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets (< >). It denotes the beginning of the element.

Attributes: The attributes are optional and provide additional information about an HTML element. They are placed within the opening tag and are written in the form of key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign (=).

Content: The content of an HTML element is the information that is placed between the opening and closing tags. It can be text, other HTML elements, or a combination of both.

Closing tag: The closing tag is the final part of an HTML element that marks the end of the element. It consists of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets preceded by a forward slash (/).

Self-closing tag: Some HTML elements don't have any content, and they can be closed in a single tag. Such elements are called self-closing tags. They consist of the opening tag followed by a forward slash (/) and the closing angle bracket.



## Difference in <article> and <section> tags 
Here are some key differences between the two:

The <section> element is used for grouping related content, while the <article> element is used for standalone content.
An <article> tag could be placed within a <section> tag, but the opposite is not true.
The <article> element is intended to be syndicated, meaning it could be republished or distributed as a standalone piece of content, while <section> is not intended to be distributed or syndicated.
To summarize, the <section> element is used to group related content, while the <article> element is used to represent standalone content that could be distributed and consumed on its own.
