# Intro to HTML

Semantic elements in HTML are important because they provide meaning and structure to the content of a webpage. By using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`, it becomes easier for search engines, screen readers, and other assistive technologies to understand and navigate the content of a webpage. This improves accessibility, usability, and search engine optimization (SEO).

HTML has six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The `<h1>` element is typically used for the main heading of the page, while the `<h2>` to `<h6>` elements are used for subheadings and other levels of hierarchy.

The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements are used to indicate superscript and subscript text, respectively. Some common uses for these elements include:

Mathematical expressions and formulas
Footnotes and references
Chemical formulas and equations
Trademarks and registered symbols
Dates and time
When using the `<abbr>` element to provide an abbreviation or acronym, the "title" attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term. For example:

`<abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>`

# Learning CSS

here are several ways to apply CSS to HTML, including:
External stylesheets: This involves creating a separate file with a .css extension and linking it to your HTML file using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.
Internal stylesheets: This involves adding your CSS code within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` `section` of your `HTML` file.
Inline styles: This involves adding your CSS code directly to the HTML element using the "style" attribute.
It is generally recommended to avoid using inline styles because they can make your HTML code harder to read and maintain. It is also more difficult to reuse styles across multiple elements when using inline styles. External and internal stylesheets are preferred because they allow you to keep your CSS code separate from your HTML code, making it easier to manage and update.


# learning JS

A sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks is a string data type in many programming languages, including JavaScript.

Four types of JavaScript operators are:

Arithmetic operators: These operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric values, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
Assignment operators: These operators assign values to variables, such as the equals sign (=) and compound assignment operators like += and -=.
Comparison operators: These operators compare two values and return a boolean value (true or false), such as greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), and not equal to (!=).
Logical operators: These operators combine multiple boolean expressions and return a boolean value, such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
One real world problem that could be solved with a function is calculating the total cost of a shopping cart. The function could take an array of items and their prices as arguments, loop through the array to calculate the total cost, and return the result. This function could be reused throughout the website or app to calculate the total cost in various contexts, such as at checkout or on a product page. By encapsulating this functionality in a function, it becomes easier to maintain and update the code, and it reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies.

An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

An else if statement is used to provide additional conditions to check if the first if statement is false. This allows for more complex branching logic in the code. For example:

if (condition1) {
  // code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code block to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // code block to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
