## Q: Explain why we need domain modeling.

A: Domain modeling helps us understand the problem domain and identify important concepts, relationships, and behaviors. It allows us to communicate effectively with stakeholders and ensure that we are building software that meets their needs.

## Q: What is domain modeling?

A: Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model of a problem domain, which includes identifying relevant concepts, relationships, and behaviors.

## Q: What are the benefits of domain modeling?

A: Domain modeling helps us to:

Understand the problem domain and its complexities
Identify key concepts, relationships, and behaviors
Communicate effectively with stakeholders
Ensure that software meets the needs of users
Facilitate collaboration among team members.

## Q: Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

A: Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are intended for tabular data, not for structuring the layout of a page. Using tables for layout can make the HTML code harder to read and maintain, and it can also create accessibility issues for users with assistive technologies.

## Q: List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

A:

<thead> - This element is used to group the header content in a table, which typically includes column headings.
<tbody> - This element is used to group the body content in a table, which typically includes rows of data.
<tfoot> - This element is used to group the footer content in a table, which typically includes summary information or totals.

## Q: What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A: A constructor is a special method in an object-oriented programming language that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called when a new object is created and it sets the initial values for the object's properties. Some advantages of using a constructor include:

It ensures that objects are properly initialized before they are used
It can reduce code duplication by providing a way to set default values for properties
It allows for more flexible and modular code by providing a way to create objects with different initial values.

## Q: How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

A: In an object literal, the this keyword refers to the object being defined. In a constructor, the this keyword refers to the object being created. When a new object is created using a constructor, the this keyword is used to set the values of that object's properties. This allows for the creation of multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique set of property values. In an object literal, the this keyword can be used to refer to the object being defined, but it does not have the same role in initializing property values.
