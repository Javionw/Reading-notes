# Reading-notes
To me "Growth mindset" Means to always think positive and don't see or anticipate failure. To persevere.

3 Reminders to keep myself in this mindset include:

1. Constantly remind myself of the "End Goal."

2. Take notes, more importantly STUDY THEM!

3. Don't get discouraged when the work gets hard/frustrating.
