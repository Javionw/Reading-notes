# What Is CSS??

Definition: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a HTML document.

Purpose: CSS is used to separate the presentation of a web page from its structure, defined using HTML. This makes it easier to maintain and update the style and layout of a website or application.

Syntax: CSS consists of rules, which consist of a selector and a declaration block. The selector identifies the HTML element(s) to which the styles should be applied, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations specifying the styles.

Selectors: CSS provides a variety of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors, which allow you to target specific elements on a web page.

Properties: CSS has a wide range of properties, such as color, font-size, padding, margin, etc., which allow you to control the appearance of HTML elements.

Box Model: The CSS box model describes how elements are sized and positioned on a web page, with a content area surrounded by padding, borders, and margins.

Layout: CSS provides a variety of layout techniques, including floating and absolute positioning, as well as flexbox and grid, which allow you to create complex and responsive layouts.

CSS Frameworks: There are a number of CSS frameworks available, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, which provide a pre-designed set of styles and components, making it easier to create websites and applications.

Preprocessors: CSS preprocessors, such as Sass and Less, extend the capabilities of CSS by adding variables, mixins, functions, and other features, making it easier to write and maintain large and complex stylesheets.
