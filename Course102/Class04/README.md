# WireFrames
Definition: Wireframes are visual representations of the structure and hierarchy of a website or application, used to plan its design and functionality.

Purpose: Wireframes help to define the layout, content placement, and functionality of a website or application, allowing designers and stakeholders to understand the user flow and make informed decisions before development.

Characteristics: Wireframes are simple, often black and white illustrations that focus on content placement and functionality, rather than color, typography, and other design elements.

Benefits: Wireframes can save time and resources by identifying and resolving design and functional issues early in the development process, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming changes later.

Types: There are different types of wireframes, including low-fidelity (basic outlines), mid-fidelity (more detailed), and high-fidelity (nearly final design) wireframes.

Tools: There are various wireframing tools available, both free and paid, including Balsamiq, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma, among others.




# HTML Basics
Definition: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is the standard language used for creating web pages.

Structure: HTML documents are structured using elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets.

Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements, such as header, footer, nav, main, article, section, etc., which provide meaning and structure to the web page content.

Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element and how it should be displayed.

Head and Body: HTML documents have two main parts: the head, which contains information about the document, and the body, which contains the content that is displayed on the web page.

Links: HTML provides a way to create links between web pages using the anchor tag, represented by the '<a>' element.

Images: The '<img>' element is used to embed images in HTML documents.

Forms: HTML forms allow users to enter data, which can be sent to a server for processing using the '<form>' element and various form controls, such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

Tables: HTML tables can be used to present data in a tabular format using the '<table>', '<tr>', '<th>', and '<td>' elements.

CSS and JavaScript: HTML can be combined with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and layout, and with JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
