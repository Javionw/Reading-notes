# Js Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be executed whenever and wherever required.

Functions are declared using the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters within parentheses, and a code block within curly braces.

Functions can take parameters as input and return a value as output.

Functions can be invoked or called by using their function name followed by parentheses.

Functions can be defined as either function expressions or function declarations.

Function expressions are created when the function is assigned to a variable, and they can be anonymous or have a named function.

Function declarations are created using the function keyword, followed by the function name and are hoisted to the top of the scope, which means that they can be called before they are defined in the code.

Functions can be used as first-class citizens in JavaScript, which means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, or returned as values from functions.

JavaScript also has higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values.

Functions can be used to create closure, which is a feature that allows a function to remember its surrounding scope even after it has been returned or executed.

The arguments object is an array-like object that can be used within functions to access the arguments passed to the function.

Functions can be made async in JavaScript, which allows the function to be paused and resumed later, giving the illusion of running in parallel with other code.

# Js Operators

Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands and produce a result.

JavaScript supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and ternary operators.

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. The = operator is the most basic assignment operator.

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false.

Logical operators perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT, and return a boolean value indicating whether the operation is true or false.

The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing a simple if-else statement. It takes three operands and returns one of two values based on the truthiness of the first operand.

JavaScript also supports several other types of operators, including type operators, unary operators, and the spread operator.

Type operators, such as typeof, can be used to determine the type of a value.

Unary operators perform operations on only one operand. The most common unary operator is the negation operator (-).

The spread operator allows an iterable to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.

It's important to understand the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript, as they determine the order in which operations are performed.

To ensure that operations are performed in the desired order, use parentheses to group expressions and override the default operator precedence and associativity.
